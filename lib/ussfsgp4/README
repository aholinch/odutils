This directory contains the jna jars distributed with USSF SGP4 binaries.
The DLL/so/dylib files for you platform should be downloaded from space-track.org and placed
in a platform specific sub directory here.

That directory needs to be added to the java.library.path and the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

You need to have a copy of the SGP4_Open_License.txt in your working directory.
